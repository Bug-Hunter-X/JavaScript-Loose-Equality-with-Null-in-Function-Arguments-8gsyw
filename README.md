# JavaScript Loose Equality with Null in Function Arguments
This code demonstrates an issue that can arise when using loose equality (==) with null values in JavaScript function arguments.  The `foo` function is intended to perform an operation only if both `a` and `b` are non-null, however, loose equality might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Problem
Loose equality (==) does not always distinguish between `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, and empty strings. This can lead to unexpected conditional logic.  If `a` or `b` is `null`, the condition `a == null || b == null` might not work as intended.

## Solution
The recommended approach is to use strict equality (===) or explicit checks for `null` and `undefined` to ensure accurate handling of null values. This approach avoids the pitfalls of loose equality.
